#+title Fantasy Football Draft Kit

This is a kit for conducting a fantasy draft. It consists of:

- Scripts to create rankings from various sources
- Util to consolidate (join) rankings into a single, weighted average ranking
- Util to view the top players for a ranking with optional filtering
- Util to remove a player from a ranking with tab completion

Here's the work flow:

1. Create source-specific player ranking using the available scripts

2. Create a consolidated, weighted average player ranking using dk-join

3. Create a directory with a copy of a particular rank named players.csv

4. Use dk-top and dk-rm to view and remove players respectively from
   players.csv
